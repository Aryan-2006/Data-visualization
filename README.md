The Problem It Solves
In data science, the initial steps of cleaning and understanding a dataset can be slowed down by the need to set up complex environments with libraries like Pandas, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib. Clarity Canvas eliminates that friction entirely, providing a powerful front-end-only tool for rapid data exploration. No backend, no setup—just pure data analysis.

✨ Key Features
💻 Zero-Setup Required: A 100% browser-based tool. Just download the index.html file and open it to get started.

📂 Intuitive CSV Upload: Easily load your local datasets into the application with a simple file picker.

🧹 Powerful Data Cleaning Suite:

Handle Missing Values: Remove rows or fill nulls with calculated mean, median, or mode.

Dynamic Data Filtering: Filter data across any column using operators like ==, >, <, and contains.

Multi-Column Sorting: Organize your data for better analysis in ascending or descending order.

📊 Interactive Chart Generation:

Visualize your data instantly with Bar, Line, Scatter, and Pie charts.

Dynamically select columns for X and Y axes to explore relationships.

🚀 Single-File & Portable: The entire application is self-contained in index.html, making it incredibly easy to share and use anywhere.

📱 Responsive Design: A clean and modern UI that works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

🛠️ How It Works
Clarity Canvas is built with simplicity in mind, using a lightweight and powerful tech stack that runs entirely on the client-side.

HTML5: For the core structure and layout.

Tailwind CSS: For a modern, responsive, and utility-first design.

Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+): For all the data manipulation logic, interactivity, and DOM updates. No frameworks needed!

Chart.js: For creating beautiful, interactive, and responsive charts.

Lucide Icons: For clean and friendly icons throughout the user interface.

The entire application logic—from parsing the CSV to performing complex filtering and rendering charts—is handled by JavaScript within a single HTML file.
